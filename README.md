## Kiosk Task Manager
Kiosk Task Manager is a simple task management application designed for small business owners with a limited number of employees. Forget about complex task management systems; this application allows you to easily and efficiently assign, track, and resolve tasks using your smartphone.

## How It Works
Create a user hierarchy, for example, a flower shop owner with administrators and employees.

The boss creates tasks and assigns them to administrators.
Administrators can reassign tasks among their subordinates.
Employees receive tasks and complete them. They can request deadline extensions, transfer tasks to other employees, or mark tasks as completed.
The boss receives notifications about completed tasks and can monitor their progress.

## Features
Simple user hierarchy.
Flexible deadline and notification customization.
Automatic translation of tasks into the employee's language.
Internal dictionary for translating keywords.
10 basic scenarios for a quick start.
Everything works "out of the box."
Notes
This is the initial version of the application, and additional features will be added in the future. Our goal is to provide a straightforward task management tool for small businesses.
